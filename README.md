This code is an exploration of using iterative algorithms and information theory to provide a
level of privacy within utilizing an inference based system. This algorithm will generate a mapping
of data such that a there is not only an increase in privacy but also a reduction in bias while slightly decreasing 
inference accuracy. This algorithm creates a frame work that can provide a exchange between bias, accuracy and privacy. 
To achieve this, an optimization problem is formulated of this non-convex system. This optimization problem is then solved 
through an iterative algorithm to provide the desired mapping. This paper is an investigation of research  done by Yulu Jin, and Professor Lifeng Lai.
